# CS6140 Assignment 3

## Overview
This assignment dives into the realm of optimization problems and machine learning, exploring both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. We tackle linear programming duality with the Complementary Slackness condition, visualize decision boundaries using Support Vector Machines (SVM), and implement Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for complex classification tasks.

## Contents
- **Task 1**: Linear Programming and Duality
- **Task 2**: SVM and Decision Boundary Visualization
- **Task 3**: MLP Classification

## Task 1: Tutorial on Complementary Slackness
We explore the concept of Complementary Slackness in linear programming. This involves understanding the interplay between primal and dual problems and how constraints in one correspond to variables in the other.

### Key Concepts
- Primal and Dual Problems
- Optimization of resources
- Linear Programming in Python using `scipy.optimize`

## Task 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Using SVMs, we create models to classify data into distinct categories with clear decision boundaries. This task involves practical implementation of different kernel functions to understand their impact on non-linear data classification.

### Features
- Visualization of SVM decision boundaries
- Kernel function comparison (Linear, Polynomial, RBF)
- Implementation with `scikit-learn`

## Task 3: MLP for Classification
We implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to solve classification problems. The task showcases the application of MLPs to the `make_moons` and `make_circles` datasets, assessing model performance through accuracy metrics and decision boundary visualization.

### Highlights
- Training and testing of MLP models
- Performance evaluation through accuracy and visual aids
- Use of `scikit-learn` for MLP implementation

##Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- SciPy
